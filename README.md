## Key Presser

KeyPresser is a Python utility module that provides an interface for simulating key press and release actions in Windows using the Direct Input method. This functionality is extremely useful for a wide range of applications, including automating repetitive tasks, testing software, or creating unique projects such as a "Twitch Plays" style game. As a singleton class, KeyPresser ensures only a single instance of key pressing functionality exists throughout your application, preventing possible conflicts or redundant operations.

This is an adaptation of the "TwitchPlays_KeyCodes"

### Using Key Presser

KeyPresser is designed to be simple and straightforward to use. Here are a few examples of the functions available:

**Getting the Singleton Instance:**
To get the singleton instance of the KeyPresser class, simply call the _get_instance()_ method:

```python
import KeyPresser

kp = KeyPresser.get_instance()
```

**Holding and Releasing a Key:**
To simulate holding a key for a certain duration and then releasing it, you can use the _hold_and_release_key()_ method. 
The following example presses and holds the "W" key for 0.5 seconds:

```python
kp.hold_and_release_key('W', 0.5)
```

**Holding a Key Indefinitely:**
If you need to hold a key indefinitely, use the _hold_key()_ method. The key will remain held until you explicitly release it:

```python
kp.hold_key('W')  # This will hold the 'W' key
# ... Some other code ...
kp.release_key('W')  # This will release the 'W' key
```

**Releasing All Keys:**
If you want to ensure all keys are released, regardless of their state, you can use the _release_all_keys()_ method:

```python
kp.release_all_keys()
```

It's important to note that the key names passed to these methods should match the ones defined in the KEY_CODES dictionary in the KeyPresser class. For a list of valid key names, you can refer to this dictionary.
